                <h3>Work</h3>
                <p>I have spent my 20s working in customer service and for the State of Georgia. Each of those positions left me with
        invaluable skills and experiences that can't be taught in a classroom. Now, I enjoy combining my past and
        current skills together to positively impact my clients.</p>
